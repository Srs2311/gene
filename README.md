Gene the discord bot

Bot I am writing to learn some more coding
current functions:
manage user roles
tf2 wiki and xkcd searches
fun extra commands

working on a idle game for discord - mushroom game
will run from the same bot
currently this adjusts the users score based on the value of their clicks
buy and shop commands are also working
